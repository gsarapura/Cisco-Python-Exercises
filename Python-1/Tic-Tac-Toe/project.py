# Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. To make it all easier for you, 
# we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:
# The computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;
# The user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;
# The first move belongs to the computer - it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
# All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)
# The user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, 
# i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
# The program checks if the game is over - there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, 
# or the game ends with a tie, your win, or the computer's win;
# The computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
# Don't implement any form of artificial intelligence - a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.
